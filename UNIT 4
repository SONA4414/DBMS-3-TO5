Unit-4
1.	Explain about insertion, updation, deletion anomalies in relational database with an example?
•	Anomalies in relational databases are errors that can occur when data is inserted, updated, or deleted.
•	These errors can cause the database to become inconsistent or inaccurate.
•	There are three main types of anomalies: insertion, update, and deletion.
Insertion anomalies:
 
•	occur when new data is added to the database and it causes an inconsistency. For example, if you try to add a new student to a database, but you forget to enter their grade, the database will be inconsistent.
Example:
Insert into student values(7, ‘G’,16, ‘PETROLEUM’,104, ‘NAMAN’); Select * from Student;
Update anomalies:
•	occur when data is updated in the database and it causes an inconsistency. For example, if you try to update a student's grade, but you only update the grade in one of the student's classes, the database will be inconsistent.
Example:
Update STUDENT
Set HOD_NAME= ‘RAHUL’ WHERE BRANCH= ‘CIVIL’;
Select * from STUDENT;
Deletion anomalies:
•	occur when data is deleted from the database and it causes an inconsistency. For example, if you try to delete a student from a database, but you forget to delete their grades, the database will be inconsistent.
Example:
Delete from STUDENT WHERE BRANCH= ‘ELECTRICAL’;
Select * from STUDENT;
Anomalies can be avoided by following certain rules when designing and using relational databases.
These rules include:
•	Using primary keys: to uniquely identify each record in the database.
•	Normalizing the database: to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.
•	Using constraints: to enforce data integrity.
