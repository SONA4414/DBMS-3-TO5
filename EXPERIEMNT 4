4.	Explain the following operators in SQL with examples
(i)	Any
(ii)	Exists
(iii)	All
 
The ANY operator:
returns a Boolean value as a result
returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition
ANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.
ANY Syntax
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY (SELECT column_name
FROM table_name WHERE condition);
The ALL operator:
•	returns a Boolean value as a result
•	returns TRIJE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition
•	is used with SELECT , WHERE and HAVING statements
ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range.

ALL syntax:
SELECT ALL column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
The SQL EXISTS Operator
•	The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
•	The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.
EXISTS Syntax SELECT column_name(s) FROM table name WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition) ;
