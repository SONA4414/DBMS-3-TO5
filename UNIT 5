Unit-5
1.	Explain about ACID properties of Transaction?
Atomicity
•	Atomicity guarantees that all of the commands that make up a transaction are treated as a single unit and either succeed or fail together.
•	This is important as in the case of an unwanted event, like a crash or power outage, we can be sure of the state of the database.
Consistency
•	Consistency guarantees that changes made within a transaction are consistent with database constraints.
•	This includes all rules, constraints, and triggers.
•	If the data gets into an illegal state, the whole transaction fails.
Isolation
•	Isolation ensures that all transactions run in an isolated environment.
•	That enables running transactions concurrently because transactions don’t interfere with each other.
Durability
•	Durability guarantees that once the transaction completes and changes are written to the database, they are persisted.
•	This ensures that data within the system will persist even in the case of system failures like crashes or power outages.

2.	Explain about conflict serializability with example?

3.	Explain about remote backup system with neat diagram.
 
•	Remote backup systems offer a flexible solution for transaction processing, enabling uninterrupted operations even in the event of primary site destruction.
•	Data and log records from a primary site are continuously backed up into a remote backup site.
•	To achieve 'wide range availability' of data, transaction processing can be performed at a primary site and a remote backup site where all data is duplicated.
•	The remote site is also called ‘secondary site’.
•	The remote site must be synchronized with the primary site, as updates are performed at the primary.
•	In designing a remote backup system, the following points are important.
a)	Detection of failure: It is important for the remote backup system to detect when the primary has failed.
b)	Transfer of control: When the primary site fails, the backup site takes over the processing and becomes the new primary site.
c)	Time to recover: If the log at the remote backup becomes large, recovery will take a long time.
d)	Time to commit: A transaction's updates should be announced only after its log records reach the backup site to ensure durability.
